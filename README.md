# Algorithms: Abdul Bari Algorithms course / Stonybrook CSE 214

## Overview
The courses covers data structures to efficiently store, organize, modify, and access data. Topics include: arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, hash tables, priority queues, and graphs. Recursive programming is heavily utilized. Fundamental sorting and searching algorithms are examined along with informal efficiency comparisons. [Abdul Bari's Alogorithms cataloge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IAPZzGSbME&list=PLDN4rrl48XKpZkf03iYFl-O29szjTrs_O) and the Stony Brook Algorithms course are used in conjunction as learning material.
